## 2. Examples/Test Cases
- Validate Understanding of the Problem.
- e.g. If the input is an empty array what do we return?
- e.g. If the input is 0 what do we return?
- e.g. Should we account for negative numbers?

EXAMPLES
**Case 1**
```
Given two arrays with positive numbers,
it should return one array with the products
of the numbers at the same index.

input:  [3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]
output: [27, 50, 77]
```
---
**Case 2**:
```
Given two empty arrays, return an empty array

input:  [], []
output: []
```

### Mental Model
**Example:**
Determine a list of all multiples of a set of factors up to a target value, then filter the list of multiples to the unique values. Finally, compute and return the sum of the unique multiples.

## 3. Data Structure
- Data structures are the way we store and retrieve data
- How we'll represent data that we'll work with when converting the input to output
- An `array` or an `object`?
- A `string`? Can we solve this problem using `string concatenation`?
- A `number`?
  - Can we solve this problem using a running `total`?
  - Do we need to `convert it` into a different `number`?
- Do we need to convert the input into a different data type?

#### pseudocode
```js
1. Create an empty array called `multiples` that will contain the list of multiples
2. Check whether the list of factors is empty. If there are no factors, set the list to `[3, 5]`
3. For every `factor` in the `factors` list:
    1. Set the `current_multiple` to `factor` to keep track of the multiples of `factor`.
    2. While `current_multiple` < `target`
        1. Is the `current_multiple` in `multiples` already?
            1. Yes - do nothing
            2. No - Append the `current_multiple` to `multiples`.
        2. Add `factor` to `current_multiple`.
4. Compute and return the sum of the numbers in `multiples`.
```

#### Formal pseudocode
```js
START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET savedNumber = value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  SET currentNumber = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
  IF currentNumber > savedNumber
    savedNumber = currentNumber
  ELSE
    skip to the next iteration

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT savedNumber

END
```

## 5. Code
- Implement the algorithm with code



#### Refactor
- Can we make the code more concise and still readable?
- Do we need to change some variable or function names?
- Should we divide functionality into other functions?
- Are we mutating the state?


#### Further Exploration
- What are other ways we can solve this problem?
